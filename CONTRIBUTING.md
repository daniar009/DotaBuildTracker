# Contributing Guidelines

## Git Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- **main**: Production-ready code
- **feature/**: New features (e.g., `feature/add-hero-filter`)
- **bugfix/**: Bug fixes (e.g., `bugfix/fix-crash-on-startup`)

### Commit Guidelines
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Reference issue numbers when applicable

### Pull Request Process
1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Make your changes and commit regularly
3. Push your branch to GitHub
4. Create a Pull Request
5. Request review from team members
6. Address feedback and merge after approval

## Code Style
- Follow Kotlin coding conventions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and small

## Testing
- Test your changes before committing
- Ensure the app builds without errors
- Test both online and offline scenarios
